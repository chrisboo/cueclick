##**Aim**

We hope to facilitate presentations by allowing users to refer to scripts and control slides remotely through their mobile devices.

##**Scope of project**

The web-page provides a site for users to show their presentation slides, and reflects what the audience will see during the presentation.

The phone application will rely on the same Google Slides API as the web-page, and combines the functionalities of clickers and cue cards to give users remote control of their presentations while displaying their scripts on their phones.

Features to be completed by mid-late June:

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will be mostly completed, allowing for the main functionalities of remote control and script reading via mobile devices.
The web-page:
   - Can be synced with the mobile application
   - Reflects slides which the target audience will see during presentations

Mobile application:
   - Allows users to sign into their google drive accounts, and access their google slides via the application
   - Allows users to choose their intended presentation
   - Generates a random ‘secret key’ for syncing
   - Can be synced with the web-page
   - Controls the presentation by swiping left and right

Features to be completed by mid-July:

Script display
   - Display the script during the presentation

Termination feature
   - Allows for the presentation to be terminated at any time
